##### Computational Scientist | Applied Mathematician | Industrial Postdoctoral Fellow | AI Researcher | Bridge Builder

### Bio

I am a Computational Scientist and Applied Mathematician with a demonstrated history of working as a researcher in Academia, Government Research Centers, and (more recently) Industry. I love being part of interdisciplinary teams that focus on solving problems whose solutions benefit our society. I am also a bridge builder that works to empower the communities I belong to by starting or organizing programs, mostly in the form of events.

Currently, I work as an Industrial Posdoctoral Fellow at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver campus, in Prof. Eldad Haber’s group. As part of my posdoc, I collaborate with the company Computational Geosciences, Inc as a member of their Artificial Intelligence reserch team. My project focuses on exploring convolutional neural network approaches for aquifer prospectivity mapping.

I hold a Ph.D. in Geophysics and Applied Mathematics from UBC, a M.Sc. in Computing and Industrial Mathematics from the Mathematics Research Center (CIMAT), and a B.Sc. in Computational Mathematics from the University of Guanajuato. Prior to earning my doctoral degree, I worked for 5+ years as a (C++) software developer at CIMAT. Throughout my studies, I conducted 5 internships at various research institutions in USA and Spain, including Lawrence Berkeley and Livermore National Laboratories.

### Research interests

I conduct research in how to design and apply numerical methods in the following topics:

convolutional neural networks for aquifer prospectivity mapping.
upscaling and multiscale methods to simulate large-scale geophysical electromagnetic forward and inverse problems in 3D. Applications of this research occur in the detection and characterization of mineral deposits and petroleum reservoirs.
mimetic multiscale methods for efficient simulation of electromagnetic fields in geophysical scenarios that include metallic-cased boreholes and fractures filled with conductive/resistive fluids. Applications of this research occur in the context of Hydraulic fracturing.
My most relevant areas of expertise are:

Partial differential equations (PDE’s) (Maxwell’s equations)
PDE constrained optimization
Discretization of PDE’s (finite volume, finite element)
Sparse linear algebra
Numerical upscaling methods
Mimetic Multiscale (finite element and finite volume) methods
Geophysical electromagnetic forward and inverse problems
Large-scale computation (high performance computing)
(More recently) Convolutional Neural Networks
